Any errors might lead to the case where you wont find clion in the vm. If such an error happens, you try running ``vagrant reload``\r\n\r\n### Login and finish installation\r\n\r\nWhen the software installation is complete, log into the VM (user and password are \"vagrant\").\r\n\r\n#### CLion\r\n\r\nInside the VM, open a terminal and run \r\n\r\n    /opt/clion-2016.2.1/bin/clion.sh\r\n\t\r\nIt wil start the actual installation wizard for CLion. \r\n\r\nIf you want to set up desktop shortcut for clion - please see the instructions available here\r\n\r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/installation-and-launching.html#desktop_shortcut\r\n\r\n#### Clion License\r\n\r\nGet the student license from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. \r\n\r\nFollow the getting started instructions from https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/quick-start-guide.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Alternate Instructions (Only if the above steps did not work for you)\r\n\r\nIf the vagrant approach does not work for you, create a new xubuntu vm manually on your machine. \r\n\r\n  Follow the instructions in this video\r\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_DpFhT_euI\r\n\r\nThen you will have to install the following packages. \r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-all-dev vim git -y\r\n\r\nGet clion manually using the following commands\r\n\r\n\tsudo wget -q http://download.jetbrains.com/cpp/CLion-${CLION_VERSION}.tar.gz\r\n\tsudo tar xfz CLion-${CLION_VERSION}.tar.gz -C /opt\r\n\t\r\nInside the VM, open a terminal and run \r\n\r\n    /opt/clion-2016.2.1/bin/clion.sh\r\n\t\r\nIt wil start the actual installation wizard for CLion. \r\n\r\nIf you want to set up desktop shortcut for clion - please see the instructions available here\r\n\r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/installation-and-launching.html#desktop_shortcut\r\n\r\n#### Clion License\r\n\r\nGet the student license from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. \r\n\r\nFollow the getting started instructions from https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/quick-start-guide.html\r\n\r\n# Step 3 - Set up SSH access to github. \r\n\r\n Follow the instructions provided here\r\n\t\r\n\thttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/\r\n\r\n# Step 4 - Review the following materials\r\n\r\n   - See this quick tour video at https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/documentation/\r\n   - Read https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.2/quick-start-guide.html. \r\n   - Watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUZyoAnPdCY for understanding how to debug with clion\r\n   \r\n**Note** - As you read the quick start guide, you will realize that clion uses cmake (https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) for describing the compilation and linking procedures. However, in this class, we will provide you the cmake files. You will only need to edit them using the Clion GUI as shown in the quick start guide.\r\n\r\n# Step 5 - Set up the class examples repository in clion.\r\n\r\n- Follow the instructions shown in this video [https://youtu.be/V76maDEsl-8](https://youtu.be/V76maDEsl-8)\r\n- The examples repostiory is available here: [https://github.com/CS3281-2016/examples](https://github.com/CS3281-2016/examples).\r\n",
